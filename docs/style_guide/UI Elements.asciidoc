4. UI Elements
--------------

In a single UI design is always a wide variety of components like "Buttons, Lists, Forms, Menus, Tabs, etc".

By giving them a guideline to follow, designers and developers will achieve consistency. These elements are divided in:

* Input Controls: These elements involve data input, modifications and call to action.
* Navigational Components: Elements that help the user to locate and understand the path between the different user interfaces of the application.
* Informational Components: Enable the organization and clarity of the information provided in the screens.

Users have become familiar with elements acting in a certain way, so choosing to adopt those elements when appropriate will help with task completion, efficiency, and satisfaction.

4.1 Input Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4.1.1 Buttons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

They are a text or image that illustrate an action and invite the user to click it. There are three types of buttons:

* Primary Button: This button will be the most used. Alone or accompanied by other type of button.
* Accent Button: Used jointly with the primary button to create a noticeable difference between buttons, therefore, both options are important, is one or the other.
* Natural Button: It is combined with the other two type of buttons. The action it performs is not critical, it referes to a minor action.

Buttons of any type can contain only text, only an icon (Bootstrap Glyphicon Halflings set) or both.

Any type of buttons will have a fixed height, while the width will vary along the word or icon containing.

4.1.2 Checkboxes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Allows the user to select one or more options from a set. Checkboxes are going to be located:

* At the right side of a word if it is the only option that the user can check

4.1.3 Expand/collapse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When there is lack of space or there is information that can be hidden momentarily to perform other actions but should be easily accessible, this resource is used. This control is illustrated by an icon from the Bootstrap Glyphicon Halflings set:

* glyphicon-resize-full:

* With icons: Used when the items involves primary actions. These actions will imply modifications on a specific element permanently or a redirection to different parts of the web site.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLima/OPWInternship/master/ui%20elements/dropdown%20menu-01.png[]

* Without icons: To display secondary actions. Actions that can be applied in a specific element but will not modify the content on the screen.
